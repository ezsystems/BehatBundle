## Writing tests


For an introduction into writing features using Behat, please refer to [Behat's official documentation](http://behat.readthedocs.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html)

BehatBundle provides the following sentences for the Browser Context:

    Authentication

        Given I am logged (in) as a(n) :role
        Given I have :role permissions
        Given I am logged in as :user with password :password
        Given I am not logged in
        Given I don't have permissions

    Common Actions

        Given I am on :path
        Given I am on/at the homepage
        Given I am on/at (the) :page page
        Given I clicked on/at (the) :button button
        Given on :pageSection I clicked at/on :button button
        Given I clicked on/at (the) :link link
        Given on :pageSection I clicked on/at link link
        Given I filled form with:
        Given I selected :label radio button
        Given I checked :label checkbox
        When I go to the homepage
        When I go to (the) :page page
        When I go to :path
        When I fill in :field with :value
        When I click on/at (the) :button button
        When on :pageSection I click at/on :button button
        When I click on/at (the) :link link
        When on :pageSection I click on/at :link link
        When I check :label checkbox
        When I select :option
        When I select :label radio button
        When I fill form with:
        Then I should be at/on (the) homepage
        Then I should be at/on (the) :page page
        Then I (should) see (the) (following) links:
        Then on :pageSection I (should) see (the) (following) links:
        Then I shouldn't see (the) (following) links:
        Then I don't see (the) (following) links:
        Then on :pageSection I shouldn't see (the) (following) links:
        Then on :pageSection I don't see (the) (following) links:
        Then I (should) see (the) links in the following order:
        Then I (should) see (the) links in this order:
        Then I (should) see (the) (following) links in:
        Then I (should) see :title title/topic
        Then I (should) see table with:
        Then I (should) see :text text emphasized
        Then on :pageSection I (should) see the :text text emphasized
        Then I (should) see :warning warning/error
        Then I (should) see the exact :text: message/text
        Then on :pageSection I (should) see the exact :text message/text
        Then I (should) see :message message/text
        Then I don't see :text message/text


In order to see all the available steps/sentences defined on a particular context (including all it's traits and parent contexts),
you can use the `--definitions` behat option with either the `l` (list) or `i` (info) parameter:

 * `$ php bin/behat --profile <profile> -dl`

It is also possible to search for steps using `-d 'search phrase'`, which will display extended info for any matching steps.


### Extending

[EzContext](Context/EzContext.php) is the base class for all [eZ Publish](http://ez.no/Products/The-eZ-Publish-Platform) BDD testing, which provides access to the kernel and all the available methods/sentences to manipulate and verify objects (see already available at [Object contexts](https://github.com/ezsystems/BehatBundle/tree/master/Context/Object)).
This is the way to go if you want only the kernel and the object managers.

To test browser interfaces you can extend [Browser context](Context/Browser/Context.php), which has several interactions defined on [CommonActions](Context/Browser/SubContext/CommonActions.php)

For REST interaction there is [REST context](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/eZ/Bundle/EzPublishRestBundle/Features/Context/Rest.php), all basic operations are already defined.

For a completely clean context you don't need anything but Behat/Mink and implement [KernelAwareContext](https://github.com/Behat/Symfony2Extension/blob/master/src/Behat/Symfony2Extension/Context/KernelAwareContext.php) if you need access to kernel (take a look at how it's done in [EzContext](Context/EzContext.php).

##### Accessing eZ Platform / Kernel services
In order to easily access container services (such as ContentService, SearchService, etc), [EzBehatExtension](ServiceContainer/EzBehatExtension.php) 
can parse annotations in Behat Contexts and inject the defined services into any method(s), using the following syntax:

``` php
/**
 * @EzService ezpublish.api.cool.service
 * @EzService ezpublish.api.evencooler.service
 */
 public function initialize(CoolService $service1, CoolerService $service2)
 {
    ...
 }
```



### Structure

BehatBundle:
```
    .
    ├── Context/                    - Base contexts are present here
    │   ├── Api/                    - Master context for API's (REST, PAPI, Commands, ...)
    │   ├── Browser/                - Master context for browser interfaces (Demo, Legacy, PlatforUI, ...)
    │   │   └── SubContext/         - Generic sub contexts for browser interfaces
    │   └── Object/                 - Context traits for object management
    ├── doc/                        - Documentation
    ├── Helper/                     - Helpers to ease the work on contexts
    └── ObjectManager/              - Object managers to prepare (and assert) the system
```

Other bundles:
```
    Features/
    ├── FeatureGroupA/            - Related features folder with feature files
    │   ├── FeatureA.feature
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── FeatureN.feature
    ├── .../
    ├── FeatureGroupN/
    └── Context                 - Context files and all coding files
        ├── <Bundle>.php          - Main context file (ex: Rest.php)
        ├── SubContext/           - Generic sub contexts in related to the main context
        ├── Helper/               - Needed helpers
        ├── OtherContextA/        - Sometimes the main context is sub divided (ex: Legacy is divided in SetupWizard and Admin til the moment)
        │ ├── Context.php         - The context class (usually called Context.php)
        │ └── SubContext/         - Its sub contexts
        ├── ...
        └── OtherContextN/
```


### Profiles

Profiles are custom names used to quickly switch testing configuration, including the used context classes, and path to feature files.
Profiles should be defined in the configuration file (behat.yml), and selected using the `--profile` argument when executing behat.

In order to create a custom profile, you should:

1. In your bundle, create the structure mentioned on [Structure](#structure) (this is *not* a requirement)
2. Write the scenarios for the features you want to test.
3. Choose the context class that corresponds to what you want to test, (either use one from BehatBundle, or extend it by implementing your own).
4. Now add the profile to `behat.yml` it should look like:
```yaml
    yourProfileName:
        suites:
            yourSuiteName:
                contexts:
                    - Namespace\To\Your\Context:
                        parameterA: valueA
                        parameterB: valueB
                    - Namespace\To\Another\Context
                paths:
                    - path/to/your/features/directory
                    - a/totally/different/path
                filters:
                    tags: @someTag && ~@undesiredTag
```

You're ready to go, create your feature files and then run:
 * `$ php bin/behat --profile yourProfileName [--suite yourSuiteName]`
